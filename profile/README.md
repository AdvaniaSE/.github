# Welcome to Advania!

This organisation is maintained by a team of Azure consultants in the business unit Knowledge Factory at Advania. 
Here you will find open source projects that are owned and maintained by Advania.
   
We specialize in helping our customers to get the most out of their cloud investment. We build Enterprise Scale Architecture platforms in Azure and help our customers to design and build their workloads in the cloud. Once started, our team of specialists offers continuous support and advice to our customers through our popular service Cloud Care.


External to the projects owned by our employer, many of us are active in the open source community as both contributors and maintainers. Some of the projects we are involved in are listed below.

### [BicepNet](https://github.com/PSBicep/BicepNet)
We like to think of this as an unofficial Bicep SDK. BicepNet is a thin wraper around the underlaying Bicep packages, developed for the Bicep PowerShell module but could be used for any other project that wants to leverage Bicep functionality in PowerShell or .NET.

Consists of two parts:
* A .NET library (BicepNet.Core) that is a thin wrapper around Bicep that exposes features of bicep as static methods, like for example Build() and Decompile().
* A PowerShell module (BicepNet.PS) that loads all Bicep assemblies in a separate assembly load context to avoid conflicts with other modules.

### [MyTesla](https://github.com/SimonWahlin/MyTesla)
Want to automate your Tesla from PowerShell? MyTesla is a module that allows you to do just that.
Goal is to support all features that is available in the Tesla mobile app.

### [PSBicep](https://github.com/PSBicep/PSBicep)
This is a community project created to enable the features provided by the Bicep CLI in PowerShell. The module provides the same functionality as Bicep CLI, plus some additional features to simplify the Bicep authoring experience.  
The module has gained quite some traction and has been downloaded more than 600 000 times.
